title: "Logo API"
description: "The Logo API allows you to retrieve logos based on a domain or stock exchange ticker, providing both high-quality images and fallback options when a logo is not available."
---

## Introduction

Let's get started with an example of how to use the Logo API. By default, logo images are returned in PNG format, and the size is 32x32 pixels for free plan users and 128x128 pixels for paid plan users. You can easily integrate this into your web application or use it in any HTML document.
The following HTML snippet demonstrates how to retrieve a logo for the domain `apple.com`:

```html
<img src="https://img.logokit.com/apple.com?token=<your-publishable-token>" />
```

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/apple.png" />
</Frame>

## Logo API Endpoint

```md Request
https://img.logokit.com/<identifier>?token=<your-publishable-token>
```

### Parameters

<ResponseField name="identifier" type="string" required>

### Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is enforced based on the user's plan. Keep this in mind to avoid hitting your limits during development. To get
more information about the rate limits, please refer to the [pricing page](https://logokit.com/pricing).

### Free vs Paid Plans

<Warning>
  Free plan users are limited to 32x32px logos. If you need higher resolution
  logos, please [upgrade here](https://logokit.com/pricing).
</Warning>

The Logo API is available for both free and paid plans. However, the free plan has limitations on the number of requests you can make per day. If you need more requests or additional features, consider upgrading to a paid plan.

## Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Retrieve logo for stock ticker">
    Let's say you want to retrieve the logo for the NASDAQ's ticker `NVDA`. You can
    do this by using the following URL:

    ```html
    <img src="https://img.logokit.com/NVDA?token=<your-publishable-token>" />
    ```

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/nvda.png" />
    </Frame>

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Get 404 HTTP response for non-existent logo">
    If you want to receive a 404 HTTP response when the logo is not available, you can
    use the `fallback` parameter in the URL and set it to `404`. This is useful for
    handling cases where the logo is not found, and you want to handle it in your
    application.
    ```md Request
    https://img.logokit.com/invalid.com?fallback=404&token=<your-publishable-token>
    ```
    
    ```bash HTTP Response
      404 Not Found
    ```
  </Accordion>
