title: "Logo API"
description: "Logo API allows you to retrieve logos based on a domain, providing both high-quality images and fallback options when a logo is not available."
openapi: "GET /{domain}"
---

## Basic Usage

The Logo API works through hotlinking company logos directly into your app or website. Simply use an image tag, and the logos will load directly from our global CDN. This approach ensures you always display the most current logo versions without managing logo files yourself. Since our service is designed for hotlinking, please note that caching or storing the logo images locally is not supported.

This HTML snippet demonstrates how to retrieve a logo for `apple.com`:

```html
<img src="https://img.logokit.com/apple.com?token=<publishable-api-token>" />
```

<Frame>![](/images/apple.png)</Frame>

## Limitations

<Info>
  Our Free Logo API plan is limited to 64x64px logos and require an
  [attribution](/attribution) link. [Upgrade ](https://logokit.com/pricing) to a
  paid plan for high resolution logos, increased rate limits and no attribution.

## Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Retrieve logo for Nvidia">
    Let's say you want to retrieve the logo for the Nvidia. You can
    do this by using the following URL:

    ```html
    <img src="https://img.logokit.com/nvidia.com?token=<publishable-api-token>" />
    ```

    <Frame>
      ![](/images/nvda.png)
    </Frame>

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Get 404 HTTP response for non-existent logo">
    If you want to receive a 404 HTTP response when the logo is not available, you can
    use the `fallback` parameter in the URL and set it to `404`. This is useful for
    handling cases where the logo is not found, and you want to handle it in your
    application.

    ```md Request
    https://img.logokit.com/invalid.com?fallback=404&token=<publishable-api-token>
    ```

    ```bash HTTP Response
      404 Not Found
    ```
