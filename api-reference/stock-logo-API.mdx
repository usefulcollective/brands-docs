title: "Stock Logo API"
description: "Stock Logo API allows you to retrieve logos based on a stock exchange ticker, providing both high-quality images and fallback options when a logo is not available."
openapi: "GET /ticker/{symbol}"
mode: "wide"
---

## Basic Usage

Stock Logo API works through hotlinking stock ticker logos directly into your app or website. Simply use an image tag, and the logos will load directly from our global CDN. This approach ensures you always display the most current logo versions without managing logo files yourself. Since our service is designed for hotlinking, please note that caching or storing the logo images locally is not supported.

This snippet demonstrates how to retrieve a logo for stock ticker `AAPL`:

```html
<img src="https://img.logokit.com/ticker/AAPL?token=<publishable-api-token>" alt="AAPL logo (identification only, no affiliation)" />
```

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/apple.png" />
</Frame>

<Note>
  By default, only the most popular exchanges are enabled on a new account. If you require access to additional exchanges, please contact us to enable them for you.
</Note>
