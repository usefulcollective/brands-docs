title: Attribution (Free Plan)
description: "As part of our commitment to providing valuable logo services to everyone, we offer a generous free plan with essential features. In return, we simply ask that free plan users include a small attribution link to LogoKit on pages where our logos appear."
---

**We give you creative freedom** in how you style and position this attribution to seamlessly blend with your website's design. While we're flexible about the presentation, we do ask that the attribution link:

- **Remains visible to your website visitors**
- **Isn't hidden behind overlays or obstructions**
- **Can be properly indexed by search engines**

This small acknowledgment helps us continue offering free logo services while growing our community. Here's a simple example you can customize to match your site's look and feel:

```markup Example attribution link
 <a href="https://logokit.com" title="Logo API">Logos provided by LogoKit.com</a>
```
