description: "Authentication is a crucial aspect of using the LogoKit APIs. It ensures that only authorized users can access the API endpoints, providing a secure environment for retrieving branding assets and information. This page outlines how authentication works for both the Logo API and Brand API, detailing the differences between the two."

## Logo API Authentication

- **Method:** Query Parameter
- **Token Type:** Publishable API Token

To authenticate requests made to the Logo API, you need to include your publishable API token as a query parameter in the request URL. They are prefixed with `pk_` and are safe to expose in client-side code. Here's is an example:

```md Request
https://img.logokit.com/apple.com?token=<publishable-api-token>
```

Where to Find Your Publishable API Token in the Dashboard:

1. Log in to your [LogoKit account](https://logokit.com/account).
2. Navigate to the [API Tokens section](https://logokit.com/account/api-tokens).
3. Your publishable token will be listed under Logo API Tokens.

## Brand API Authentication

- **Method:** HTTP Header
- **Token Type:** Secret API Token

Brand API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer token authentication. You must provide a valid API token in the `Authorization` header of your request. This token is used to verify your identity and grant access to the API. Make sure to keep this secret API token secure and do not share it publicly. You can find yours in [your account](https://logokit.com/account/api-tokens) under Brand API Tokens. Brand API tokens are prefixed with `sk_` and should be kept secret. Here is an example of how to include it in your request:

```bash Request
curl "https://api.logokit.com/brands/<identifier>" \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer: <secret-api-token>"
```
