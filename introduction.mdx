## Can I use third-party logos in my application?

It is is generally permissible to use a third-party logo under the "fair use" principle, which permits referencing a brand for informational purposes. Before including a third-party logo, ask yourself:
Can I replace this logo with the brand's name and still communicate the
same information effectively? If the answer is yes, you're likely operating
within acceptable legal boundaries in most jurisdictions. <b>Best Practices</b>:

- Use logos only for clear identification or informational purposes
- Ensure the usage doesn't imply endorsement or partnership unless authorized
- This guidance is general in nature. Consult with legal counsel for specific use cases or when in doubt
