## Rate Limit Responses

When you exceed your rate limits, the API will respond with a `429 Too Many Requests` status code. This response indicates that you've reached your plan's limit for the current time period.

## Monitoring Your Usage

You can monitor your API usage at any time by visiting your [account dashboard](https://logokit.com/account). The dashboard provides detailed insights into:

- Current usage statistics
- Remaining quota
- Historical usage patterns
- Rate limit thresholds

## Rate Limit Notifications

To help you manage your API usage effectively, we provide proactive notifications when you're approaching your rate limits.
These notifications help you plan ahead and upgrade your plan if needed, ensuring uninterrupted service for your applications.
